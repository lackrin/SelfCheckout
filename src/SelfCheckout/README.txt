General Info: to add sales or load inventory you'll need to enter the Admin console. enter- ududlrlrab -on main screen to enter this.
			this admin control is hard coded.


Assumptions:

	1) Inventory will be in proper format: files should be in the format of "name, price, name, price etc.." otherwise this will fail during the import and thow an unhandled exception
	2) Cart files will be in proper format: items should be comma delimited list
	3) name will not contain comma's, i could program around this but i didnt, so no comma's in your imput's or itll all fall apart.
